When we first launched the Google News Initiative (GNI), the vastness and diversity of Asia Pacific and its media landscape felt daunting. In countries like India and Japan, newspapers remain extremely popular. In Korea, news aggregators are the go-to way to get the news. Digital-first media have blossomed in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Malaysia—and been very successful in challenging incumbents.

It quickly became clear that we couldn’t simply adapt GNI programs to Asia Pacific. We had to build programs for the region from scratch, tailored to local news businesses’ needs. 

As our first GNI Impact report shows, we’ve invested $33 million in Asia since March 2018, working with more than 1,000 news partners in 32 countries. That includes financial help provided through the Journalism Emergency Relief Fund, which we launched earlier this year to support publishers through the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Elevating quality journalism and fighting misinformation

Misinformation in Asian countries isn’t always that sophisticated. Usually it comes in the form of images or videos with a misleading headline, but it can easily and quickly spread in Asia’s mobile-first, highly-connected communities. 

We set out to help tackle this by setting up training initiatives for journalists, equipping them with fact-checking skills and creating networks to foster cooperation between news organizations. Media in Asia are very open to collaboration—they recognize that a stronger news industry comes from working together, through initiatives like Cekfakta, an Indonesian fact-checking coalition uniting 24 media organizations. Across the region, we’ve trained more than 79,000 journalists in person and more than 418,000 online (through the GNI Training Center) since 2015.
