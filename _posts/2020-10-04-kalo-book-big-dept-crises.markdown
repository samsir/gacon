This year we’ve seen people around the world change the way they purchase goods and services in response to the pandemic. This is causing businesses to rethink growth strategies, with many turning to digital transformation to address rapidly changing customer needs and new challenges. With Google’s integrated marketing tools, marketers can discover the industry and customer insights that can prepare their business for what’s next.

In our new solution guide for Google Marketing Platform and Google Cloud, we share the successes of leading organizations who have used machine learning to unlock new insights to create extraordinary customer experiences that strengthen their brand and help grow their business.
