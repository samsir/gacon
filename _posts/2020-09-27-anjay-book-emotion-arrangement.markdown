There are two universal truths about the state of the news industry today: Demand for quality journalism has never been higher, and the need for news businesses to embrace the transition to digital has never been more critical. When we launched the Google News Initiative in 2018, many news businesses might have presumed they had time to make this shift in a methodical and considered way. COVID-19 changed that timetable drastically.

The unanticipated upheaval of this year has affected how we continue to enable innovation in news. In planning for the future, it’s helpful to know what we’ve learned from the past. Our first GNI Impact Report looks at what we have done in collaboration with the news industry over the last couple of years to see what worked and where there are opportunities for growth.

Over the last two years, the Google News Initiative has supported more than 6,250 news partners in 118 countries through $189 million in global funding, programs, tools and resources.

Beyond the numbers, we’ve learned that different parts of the world need different approaches, from small local outlets and large cross-border publishing operations in Europe, to news organizations serving the diversity of populations and languages in Asia Pacific. In Latin America, the lack of capital available to digital news startups has put a focus on transformation of legacy organizations and sustainable growth for news entrepreneurs. In the Middle East and Africa, the swift digital transformation and steep rise in local content creation provides exciting opportunities for news. And this year, the unfolding pandemic and social justice issues in North America have crystallized the importance of local news.
