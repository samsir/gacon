I"´<p>Five years ago, as we saw news publishers shifting towards digital formats and trying new ways of doing things in the internet era, we set up the Digital News Innovation (DNI) Fund to promote innovation and quality journalism.

Today weâ€™re releasing a final impact report to show where the funds went and how publishers used them.</p>
