I"≈<p>When fire struck Okinawa‚Äôs Shurijo Castle in October 2019, it damaged a part of Japanese history dating back to the Ryukyu Kingdom of 1429-1879.</p>

<p>The Japanese government is planning to rebuild the site‚Äîbut that process will take time. To preserve and highlight the castle‚Äôs heritage and culture in the meantime, Google Arts &amp; Culture and the Okinawa Prefectural government are launching a digital project called Reconstructing Shurijo Castle.</p>

<p>We spoke with Denny Tamaki, the Governor of Okinawa, about the exhibition‚Äôs significance.</p>

<p>Tell us what you‚Äôre most excited about with this project.</p>

<p>It would definitely be the 3D reconstructed models of Seiden Temple, the main temple of Shurijo Castle. The model was built by a group of engineers, students and computer vision and VR researchers. They collected 80,000 photos shared by 3,000 people across the globe who wanted to see the digital reconstruction of this beloved site and preserve the legacy of Ryukyu culture for generations to come.</p>

<p>We hope this online exhibition will rekindle fond memories for those who have visited Shurijo Castle, and that those who have yet to see the site will be even more excited about visiting once it‚Äôs restored.</p>

<p>What are some of the other highlights for you?</p>

<p>One of the stories allows you to experience the beauty of the castle from an architectural point of view. You can explore the Main Hall of the castle, which was decorated using Ryukyuan lacquerware, characterized by its vivid red color, the use of inlaid seashells and various Ryukyuan artistic motifs incorporating Japanese and Chinese influences.</p>

<p>There is also ‚ÄúThen and Now: Shurijo Castle From The Sky‚Äù, which begins with a drawing of Shurijo Castle from the first half of the 19th century. It gives you a bird‚Äôs eye view of the castle over the years, including after the tragic fire of 2019, and through to the restoration efforts underway today.</p>
