I"<p>On April 28, 1996 at the historical Port Arthur site in Tasmania, 35 people were tragically killed. Alannah and Madeline Mikac, aged six and three, along with their mother, died that day. Because of this terrible act of violence, Alannah and Madeline’s father, Walter Mikac AM, and a small group of volunteers, created the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation with the belief that all children should have a safe and happy childhood. For more than 20 years, the Alannah &amp; Madeline Foundation has worked to safeguard every child’s basic right to live free from violence and serves as a beacon of hope for a better, safer world.</p>
